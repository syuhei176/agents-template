# Spec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/specs/AGENTS.md` when the request falls under any of the following cases:

- When **adding a new feature or capability**  
- When **explicitly asked to write a spec**  
- When **asked to write a spec based on implementation details or existing code**

Use `@/specs/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
